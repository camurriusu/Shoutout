## **Welcome to Shoutout**
### **What is it?**
I started this project for my CS50 2021 Final Project, and the purpose of the website application I made was to send and receive messages between two users. To be frank, *Shoutout* isn't supposed to replace WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, and other chat-based applications. *Shout out* is, in fact, not made to be like a chat - it lacks functions such as replying, mentioning, stories, and anything else that defines a social media platform.

*Shoutout* is, in its current state, more of a memo app, where users exchange fairly short messages (maximum of 100 characters per message) to exchange important and quick-to-the-point information. Use in a business, organisation, hospital, whatever you like. Of course there is much to improve still in this version of *Shoutout*, especially in the aspect of being user-friendly and perhaps more time-saving functions. Nevertheless, I am still proud of this small project, which also has so much potential for me to continue working on.

## **Taking a look inside**
---
- ### **`app.py`**
Below the various imports, the first lines of code you will see is this:
```py
load_dotenv()
db = SQL("sqlite:///data.db")
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SESSION_TYPE'] = 'filesystem'
app.secret_key = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
```
Flask requires a `SECRET_KEY`, which is why I used `dotenv`.\
I used CS50's library called `SQL`, so that I could easily execute *Sqlite3* commands within `data.db`.

---
- #### **Flask Tables**
```py
class Contacts(Table):
    classes = ["table table-striped"]
    thead_classes = ["table-dark"]
    id = Col('User ID', show=False)
    fname = Col('First name')
    sname = Col('Surname')
    username = Col('Username')
    bdate = Col('Birth Date')
    send = LinkCol('Send', 'sendto', url_kwargs=dict(username='username', id='id'))
```
For this project I needed dynamic tables to list the users available and to show messages sent and received, so I used [Flask Tables](https://flask-table.readthedocs.io/). First, you make a `class` like shown above. Each column of the table created is a `Col` object. The first two variables, `classes` and `thead_classes`, are used to implement Bootstrap 5 CSS classes. They are the equivalent of writing:
```html
<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead class="table-dark">
```
`Messages` class is essentially the same thing but for a different purpose. While `Contacts` is used to list all users in `contacts.html`, the following class `Messages` is used to present the user with messages they sent and received.
- #### **`reqlogin` decorator**
```py
def reqlogin(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if session.get("user_id") is None:
            return redirect("/login")
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function
```
This is a slightly altered `@login_required` decorator you can find [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/patterns/viewdecorators/#login-required-decorator). What this `reqlogin` does, is redirect a user who tries to access a page like `contacts.html` to the `login.html` page if they are not yet logged in.

Speaking of logging in...

---
- #### **`login`**
```py
@app.route('/login', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    session.clear()
    if request.method == "POST":
        rows = db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", request.form.get("uname"))
        
        if len(rows) != 1 or not check_password_hash(rows[0]["hash"], request.form.get("password")):
            return render_template("login.html", err=True)

        session["user_id"] = rows[0]["id"]
        session["username"] = rows[0]["username"]

        return redirect("/")
    else:
        return render_template("login.html", err=False)
```
This is the code that logs in a user. First, `rows` is used to check if the username or password entered exist. I use the `err` boolean so that it shows the following alert in case of a user's mistake:
```html
{% if err %}
    <div class="alert alert-danger alert-dismissible fade show">
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert"></button>
        <strong>Login failed.</strong> Maybe you want to <a href="/register" class="alert-link">register</a>?
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

![Alert](docs/alert.PNG)

I also had no need to check whether the user inputted a username or password, as Bootstrap can do that for me:
```html
<div class="invalid-feedback">Please fill out this field.</div>
```
Finally, if everything goes well, the user's `id` is stored in `session["user_id"]`, and username in `session["username"]. Then they are redirected to `contacts.html`.

But what if a user has to register?

---
- #### **`register`**
The register function is slightly more complicated than `login`. Now it must also check if the user has properly entered username and password, following the requirements below:

A user can only register if:

- `fname` has more than 1 character.
- `sname` as more than 2 characters.
- `age` must be between `1900-01-01` and `2008-01-01`.
- `pw` matches with `request.form.get("confirmation")`.
- `username` has more than 4 characters.
- `pw` must have at least:
  - 8 characters.
  - a digit.
  - and a capital letter.
```py
if len(pw) < 8 or any(s.isdigit() for s in pw) == False or any(s.isupper() for s in pw) == False:
    return render_template("register.html", alert="Password must have at least 8 characters, one number, and one capital letter.")
```
If any of these requirements are not respected, when `Register` is clicked, they will be met with an alert similar to the one in `login`. The alert's message is passed through `alert` in `render_template()`.

If the user has registered properly, the following code will add their data to `data.db`:
```py
db.execute("INSERT INTO users (fname, sname, bdate, username, hash) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)", fname, sname, request.form.get("age"), uname, generate_password_hash(pw))
```
As you can see, the user's first name, surname, birth date, username, and password are stored in `data.db`. Now they can log into the website by clicking 'Login' and filling out username and password.

![Login Page](docs/login.PNG)

---

- #### **`contacts`**
Once the user logs into *Shoutout*, they will first be redirected to `contacts.html`. This is where the user will see the table `Contacts(Table)` which lists all users who are currently registered in *Shoutout*, and the results are ordered alphabetically.
```py
def contacts():
    qry = db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id != ? ORDER BY fname ASC;", session["user_id"])
    contacts = Contacts(qry)
    return render_template('contacts.html', table=contacts)
```
I first run `qry` which returns all users ordered alphabetically that don't have the same `id` as the logged user. Then `qry` is passed into `Contacts(Table)` to create all of the `Col` objects needed.
```html
{% block main %}
<div class="container">
    <h3>Contacts:</h3>
    {{ table }}
</div>
{% endblock %}
```
You might be wondering what `LinkCol` (in the `Contacts` class) means. It is similar to a `Col` object as it has it's own header ('Send'), but in each row `send` is a link to `sendto.html`:

![LinkCol](docs/sendlink.PNG)

When you click `Send`, you will be redirected to `sendto.html` where you can write a message to the user who shares the same row as the 'Send' you clicked:

![Send to user](docs/sendto.PNG)

How does this work?

---
- #### **`sendto`**
Let's take a look at the last line of `Contacts`:
```py
send = LinkCol('Send', 'sendto', url_kwargs=dict(username='username', id='id'))
```
`LinkCol` takes in a few arguments. `'sendto'` is the 'endpoint'; where the link will take you. `url_kwargs` is needed to use `username` and `id` as arguments. What this means is that the user will be redirected to a link similar to the `@app.route` below.

Once you click 'Send', you will be sent to (in this case): *`/sendto/jeffh4`*. *`jeffh`* is the username that was passed to `url_kwargs` earlier, and *`4`* is jeffh's `id` that was passed with that username.

Once you write whatever message you like and click the 'Send' button, the following code will run:
```py
@app.route('/sendto/<string:username><int:id>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@reqlogin
def sendto(username, id):
    if request.method == "POST":
        content = request.form.get("msg")
        db.execute("INSERT INTO messages (sender, receiver_id, content, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)", session["username"], id, content, time.time())
        
        return render_template("/sendto.html", user=username, alert="Message sent!")
    else:
        return render_template("/sendto.html", user=username)
```
Under `if request.method == "POST":` (which becomes true once you press Send), *`content`* is the message that was written. To finally send the message, `sender`, `receiver_id` (*jeffh*'s id), `content` (the message), and `time.time()` (current epoch time) are stored in the `messages` table in `data.db`.

The reason why I use epoch time instead of a readable date like '2021-12-10 10:32:55', is because it's easier to sort `Messages` (in `messages.html`) by time when using a number. Of course in `messages.html`, `time.time()` will be converted back to a standard date.

---
- #### **`send`**
There is a different yet very similar way to send a message to a user. Instead of finding someone in `contacts.html`, if one knows the username of the person they need to send a message to already, they could click 'Send' (next to 'Contacts' in the `navbar`). In our case we know Jeff Harold's username to be `jeffh` (it might be useful in an organisation to have everyone's username to follow a rule, like in our case, first name and then surname's initial), so we fill the *'Send to:'* field with his username and *'Content:'* with our message.

![Send](docs/send.PNG)

Once we click 'Send', this happens:
```py
if request.method == "POST":
    receiver = db.execute("SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ?", request.form.get("uname"))
    content = request.form.get("msg")
    db.execute("INSERT INTO messages (sender, receiver_id, content, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)", session["username"], receiver[0]['id'], content, time.time())
    
    return render_template("/send.html", alert="Message sent!")
```
As you can see, the code is the same as `sendto()`. You might have noticed that the `alert` variable I am passing to `send.html` is similar to what is used to display an alert if a user fails a log-in attempt in `login.html`:

!["Message sent!" Alert](docs/sentalert.PNG)

---
- #### **`messages`**

This is the last function in `app.py`. If you click 'Messages' in the `navbar`, you will be sent to `messages.html`, which looks like this:

![No messages](docs/nomessages.PNG)

First, you must select a user from the dropdown menu, then click Go. Afterwards, you will be presented with a table that lists all the messages you sent to and received from the user selected.

![Messages](docs/msg.PNG)

We can see our previous message! If jeffh responds, we will see that too. Note that the new lines I entered originally in the message are unfortunately ignored here. Of course the table is ordered by time, so that the latest message  will always come first.

```py
def messages():
    if request.method == "POST":
        users = db.execute("SELECT username FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT receiver_id FROM messages WHERE sender = ?) OR (SELECT sender FROM messages WHERE receiver_id = ?)", session["username"], session["username"])
        username = request.form.get("select")
        if username == 'Select a user':
            return render_template("/messages.html", table=None, users=users)
        
        userid = db.execute("SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)
        qry = db.execute("SELECT * FROM messages WHERE (receiver_id = ? AND sender = ?) OR (receiver_id = ? AND sender = ?) ORDER BY date DESC", userid[0]['id'], session["username"], session["user_id"], username)
        messages = Messages(qry)
        
        return render_template("/messages.html", table=messages, users=users)
    else:
        users = db.execute("SELECT username FROM users WHERE id != ?", session["user_id"])
        
        return render_template("/messages.html", table=None, users=users)
```
Above is the code that shows us the messages. `users` are the people who sent or received a message to or from us before (which will appear in the dropdown menu). Then `username` is what we chose from the menu.
If `username` is it's default value `'Select a user'` then the table should return `None`. If instead we do select someone from the menu, then `userid` will get our `id`, and finally `qry` finds every message that our user received from or sent to whoever we selected in the dropdown menu. Finally, `qry` is passed to `Messages()` to create the table we need, which is shown to us in `messages.html`.

- ### **`layout.html` and `styles.css`**

`layout.html` is what each page in *Shoutout* has in common.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width">
```
The line of code above helps to make the website mobile-friendly.

First, I import both Bootstrap 5 and its icons, then `styles.css`. Bootstrap was extremely useful when making the website as it offers various buttons, alerts, containers, tables, etc. that look good and have great functionality.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.7.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
<!-- At the end of <body>:-->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
I then set the title (which changes depending on what page you're on) and the website icon to appear next to the title.

Now we dive into the `<body>` of each page. First:
```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-dark navbar-dark">
```
This defines the Bootstrap navigation bar that people use to navigate the website.
```html
<a class="navbar-brand" href="/">SHOUTOUT</a>
```
Above, we have the brand name inside the `navbar` which is also a link to the home page (`contacts.html`).

For phones and small screens, the navigation bar can collapse into a button like this:

![Collapsed Navbar](docs/collapsenav.PNG)

Using Jinja logic, I can tell the website to only show Contacts, Send, Messages, and Logout if the user is logged in: `{% if session.user_id %}`.
Else (or better, `{% else %}`) the only links you can navigate to are Register and Login.

To use Bootstrap icons in links and buttons, I choose what icon to use from [here](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). Then you simply copy the HTML it gives you and you can use it wherever you want.

```html
<main class="container p-5">
    {% block main %}
    {% endblock %}
</main>
```
Here is what makes each page different. Buttons, menus, tables, etc. are inside the `<main>` of this layout.

## **This is it!**
The end of this `README.md` file. This project was made as a Final Project for CS50 2021 (and maybe I will continue working on it).

**This was CS50. Goodbye👋**
